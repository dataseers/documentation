# Numbers

## Commas and decimal points in numbers

Use commas and decimal points in accordance with standard American number-formatting.

Specifically: in numbers four or more digits long, use commas to set off groups of three digits, counting leftward from the decimal point, in the standard American style. For long decimal numbers, do not use any digit-group separators to the right of the decimal point. For example:

- The limit is 1,532,784 bytes per day.
- The API supports up to 2,000 vertices.

## Currency

Make sure that it's clear what country's currency you are describing. For more information, see the [currency](https://developers.google.com/style/units-of-measure#currency) section in Units of measurement of the Google style guide.

For US dollars, use a comma to delineate the thousands place of whole currency. Use a period to delineate whole currency and fractions of currency. Always include the dollar sign ($) at the beginning of the currency. Do not use any punctuation or spaces to the right of the decimal.

## Range of numbers

Use a hyphen with no space on either side of it. For example:

- 2012-2016
