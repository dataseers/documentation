## Commas and decimal points in numbers

Use commas and decimal points in accordance with standard American number-formatting.

Specifically: in numbers four or more digits long, use commas to set off groups of three digits, counting leftward from the decimal point, in the standard American style. For long decimal numbers, do not use any digit-group separators to the right of the decimal point.
